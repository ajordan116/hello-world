Statistics for Data Science Repo
**Week 1 Assignment**
## My name is Andrew Jordan
I am in my second semester of Bellevue's Data Science program and while I find coding a daunting skill to learn, I am excited to add it to my repetoire. 
Upon completion of my Masters I would like to achieve the following goals:
1. Begin work on my PhD in Data Science
2. Get a position as a Professor while working on my doctorate
  + Whether full-time or adjunct, it does not matter to me, I just want to start teaching at a college level
3. Finish my doctorate
4. Get a position as a tenure-track Professor
  + Ideally at a research university
